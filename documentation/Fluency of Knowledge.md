**Fluency:** The state in which correct action or expression emerges directly from internalized structure rather than conscious retrieval or rule application.

In language, fluency means speaking without translating, recalling grammar rules, or assembling sentences step-by-step. Because the speaker has deeply internalized the structural and functional logic of the language, correct grammar, word choice, and expressions flow naturally without having to perform conscious analysis. New vocabulary or structures may appear which require some active mental connection to understand, but this process is relatively quick because they are simply harmonizing the new information with the existing robust system. They don't need extensive additional explanations because they can use context clues to understand how the new structure perfectly fits into their existing mental model. 

This concept can be applied to any other domain as well. I propose the following general definition: Thinking or acting without rehearsing definitions, formulas, or procedures. It is the functional opposite of *memorization*, where the idea or action comes from active recollection from a set of disjointed facts. This general fluency reflects an intuitive understanding of the system's constraints - the latent rules, relationships, boundaries, and purposes behind the architecture. 

Like how a chess master can quickly recall a board position that they've briefly seen much more accurately than a non-chess player, but there is no significant difference between the two groups in recalling randomly placed pieces @chasePerceptionChess1973; @gongRecallBrieflyPresented2015 -  having a base of semantic knowledge allows you to quickly and intuitively associate never-before-seen information with your existing mental model. Chess players do not have better visual memory than non-chess players, they just are able to categorize topics from their specific knowledge base in a way that is inacceptable for others. The same principle applies when comparing students in a field to professionals. While learning, students do not have day-to-day experience working with the topics and therefore feel as though they must memorize through flashcards and quizzes. However, people who deal with those topics on a regular basis in a practical manner do not have to memorize, because they already have a functional mental model. This concept can be applied to the students' case as well: instead of presenting them with tidbits to memorize, work with them to build a functional mental model (small and incipient at the beginning, but will grow with time) so that new information can fit in. The downside to this is that there is a delay in uptake of useable information. A biology student who spent an entire semester learning about basic relationships between body systems and their main conceptual constraints may not do well on a test asking about anatomical taxonomy. But, on the flip side, if the student continues to truly understand the subject from a systems perspective, when they eventually get to learning the fine details they will learn much quicker and the information will stick. Complex advanced topics will have shallower learning curves, and when they get to them they will achieve *fluency* more easily than their colleagues who learned traditionally.     

The end result of fluency is that only a narrow set of responses to a situation seem possible, and the correct one arises automatically. Errors feel immediately wrong, effort shift from planning to doing, and correct actions feel inevitable. Fluency is not about speed, it's the absence of cognitive friction that occurs when someone has fully internalized the conceptual backbone. It's that feeling you get when FINALLY a complex concept has been explained in the perfect way, and you'll never forget it again because the knowledge is not floating on the surface but is ingrained in the way you even *start* thinking about problems in the respective domain.
