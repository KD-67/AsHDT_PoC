In order to truly understand a concept, one must decompose it into its most fundamental elements. We all do this subconsciously what thinking about an object or concept, automatically categorizing it into one of several categories. It is the basic mechanism of [[Fluency of Knowledge]]. I want to define this process at the lowest level, in a way that is able to capture any sort of explainable concept such that it may be further analyzed, for instance to create a [[Minimum Viable Framework (MVF)]] and [[Intuitive Framework Narrative (IFN)]]. I propose 5 possible ontological categories and 2 possible teleological categories, which when combined can for 10 possible general descriptions that are the basis to understanding anything. 

Ontology (what is it):
- **Configuration**
	- Structured arrangement of components, *defined by architecture*
- **Process**
	- Longitudinal transformation, *defined by state transitions*
- **Representation**
	- Logical conclusion, *defined by causal relationship between ideas*
- **Framework**
	- Rule set, *defined by success/fail criteria*
- **Property**
	- System attribute, *defined by measurability and dependence* 

Teleology (why does it persist in a universe trending towards increasing entropy):
- **Functional**
	- Contributes to stabilizing, solving, or regulating constraints within a larger system 
- **Intrinsic**
	- Stable structure that is solely a consequence of external factors


Here are some examples for each of the 10 combinations:
1. **Functional configuration**
	- Heart - structured arrangement of atoms that persists to maintain stability in the organism with the purpose of maintaining homeostasis
	- Corporation - structured arrangement of capital that persists to coordinate economic forces with the purpose of making money
2. **Intrinsic configuration**
	- Crystal - structured arrangement of atoms resulting as a byproduct of an external system, that persists because of its stable structure
	- Hierarchy - structured arrangement of classes resulting as a byproduct of an external relationships, that persists because of its stable structure
3. **Functional process**
	- Thermoregulation - physiological state transitions that function actively to maintain temperature
	- Science - procedural sequence of actions that actively coordinate evidence to generate knowledge
4. **Intrinsic process**
	- Erosion - material transformation resulting as a byproduct of external forces, does not itself seek to accomplish anything specific
	- Language drift - vocabulary/grammar transformation resulting as a byproduct of active usage, natural consequence as opposed to specific declared goal
5. **Functional representation**
	- Legal argument - logical conclusion of defendant's actions in the context of current laws, specifically constructed to defend a claim
6. **Intrinsic representation**
	- The Pythagorean Theorem - logical consequence of axioms
7. **Functional framework**
	- Card game rules - set of rules that must be followed for gameplay to exist
8. **Intrinsic framework**
	- Laws of physics - defines the constraints of any physical system
9. **Functional property**
	- Credit score - numerical property specifically designed to judge aspects of people's financial behavior
10. **Intrinsic property**
	- Mass - attribute of matter due to a physical law
	- Quantity - attribute of a set due to definitional constraints
