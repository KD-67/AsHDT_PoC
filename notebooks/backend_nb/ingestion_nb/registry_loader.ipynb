    "##### Registry loader function:\n",
    "When the FastAPI server first starts, it needs to know what modules and markers are defined in the system so it can validate incoming requests and populate menus on the frontend forms. This is not hardcoded, but rather stored spearately in 'registry/module_registry.json'. There, all active modules are defined, along with the information that each reading comes with. This happens just ONCE at startup.\n",
    "\n",
    "The 'load_registry()' function (defined here) does three things:\n",
    "\n",
    "    1. **Opens the registry file:** it takes the path to the registry JSON as an argument, and opens it. If the file doesn't exist, it's designed to give a big error (RunTimeError) instead of trying to keep going without necessary information.\n",
    "\n",
    "    2. **Parses the JSON:** it reads the contents of the registry JSON and converts it into a Python dictionary (data structure that stores key-value pairs) called *'registry'*.\n",
    "\n",
    "    3. **Returns the dictionary:** It sends the dictionary. Since the function is called by 'main.py', that's the program that uses it (stores it in 'app.state.registry', which is accessible by every route so the original JSON doesn't have to keep being re-opened and re-read.) "
